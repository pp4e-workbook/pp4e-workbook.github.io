Kindergarten Cipher |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jess is a kindergarten teacher who taught her students the letters just
recently. Now, the students can read, and they love to play with
letters. One day, she noticed that one of the students used numbers
instead of some letters, and she wanted to decipher what the students
wrote. So, after finding which number corresponds to which letter, she
decided to write a Python function to solve them.

Write a function named *decipher* that takes two arguments, the ciphered
text and a solution list, and return the deciphered text.

*Hint:* You can use a string method for the replacement of a character
in a string.

   Haskell is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.

   APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed by Kenneth e. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array.
