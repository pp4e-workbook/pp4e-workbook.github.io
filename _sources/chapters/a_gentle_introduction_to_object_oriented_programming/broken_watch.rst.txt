Broken Watch |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*(Before looking at this question and the rest of this chapter of
workbook, you are strongly recommended to take a look into the commonly
used methods of built-in containers from the*
`textbook <https://pp4e-book.github.io/chapters/ch7_OOP.html#widely-used-member-functions-of-containers>`__\ *.)*

Deniz wanted to check the time, but his watch broke. So he asked Aslı to
tell him the time. But Aslı doesn’t always tell the truth, so the time
she says may not be valid.

Write a function named *is_time_valid* to determine whether a given time
is correct or not.

Note that the given time is only valid when the given string is between
00.00 and 23.59.

*Hint:* You need to divide the given string into the hour and minute
parts somehow.

.. container:: sampleio

   Sample I/O:

.. |2| image:: ../../figures/difficulty_one.png
   :class: difficulty

.. code:: default

   >>> is_time_valid("23.20")
   True

   >>> is_time_valid("22.61")
   False

   >>> is_time_valid("ten past eleven")
   False
