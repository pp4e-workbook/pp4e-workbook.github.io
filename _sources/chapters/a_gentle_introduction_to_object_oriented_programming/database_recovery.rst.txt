Exercise: Database Recovery |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our database has broken. Fortunately, we have a backup database.
However, the data was stored as a string. We need to rearrange it. Can
you help us?

Write a function named *reinstall* that has to do the following three
tasks: 1- Separate the rows 2- Clean and prettify the data 3- Save the
data

The input of function will be given in the following format:

| Entry-1 : Number-1 \|=\| Entry-2 : Number-2 \|=\| â€¦

The return value should be a dictionary where the keys are the given
entries, and the values are the numbers corresponding to these entries.
You also need to make sure that each entry starts with a capital letter
and continue with the lowercase characters.

   :class: difficulty

.. code:: default

   >>> reinstall("| ahmet : 16 |=| Mehmet : 19 |=| selin : 32 |=| PINAR : 8 |")
   {'Ahmet': 16, 'Mehmet': 19, 'Pinar': 8, 'Selin': 32}

   >>> reinstall("| SiLa : 2 |=| AbDuLlAh : 28 |=| PeLIN : 49 |=| PolaT : 99 |")
   {'Abdullah': 28, 'Pelin': 49, 'Polat': 99, 'Sila': 2}
