Capitalize Sentences |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a function named *capitalize_sentences* which takes a string
including multiple sentences and return a string where the first letter
of each sentence in the original string is converted to uppercase to
correct the typos.

A sentence may end with the following characters: ``'.'``, ``'?'``,
``'!'``. Your function should not interfere with other parts of the
string.

You may assume that there will be a single blank character between each
sentence. You must preserve this blank character in the recovered
string. There will be no blank characters after the last sentence.
