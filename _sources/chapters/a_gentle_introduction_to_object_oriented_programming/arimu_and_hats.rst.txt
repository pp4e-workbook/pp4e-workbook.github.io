Exercise: Arimu and Hats |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our friend Arimu loves hats and wants to buy as many hats as possible.
Unfortunately, he canâ€™t always afford all the hats in the store. So he
needs to spend his money wisely, to be able to purchase the maximum
number of hats.

Write a function named *buy_hats* which takes a *list of integers* as
the costs of hats and an *integer* as Arimuâ€™s money. This function finds
the maximum number of hats Arimu can buy and returns it as an *integer*.

*Hint: You might want to rearrange the list of hats in the increasing
order of their prices.*
