Shopping List |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is your turn to buy groceries. Your friend sends you a shopping list.
But you have a problem, the list is difficult to read. The items are
separated by commas, uppercase and lowercase characters are mixed up and
there are blank spaces all over. So you decide to make the list
readable.

Write a function named *readable* that takes input as a *string*, the
shopping list, separated by commas. You need to print each item in a
single line, with no leading blank spaces, and in lowercase letters.
