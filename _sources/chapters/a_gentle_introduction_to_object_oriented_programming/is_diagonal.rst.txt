Is Diagonal |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In mathematics, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which all non-diagonal
entries are zero. That is, :math:`\mathbf{A_{i,j} = 0}` if
:math:`\mathbf{i\neq j}`. Since it is easier to work with diagonal
matrices, we should check them if they are diagonal or not.

Write a function called *is_diagonal* that takes an
:math:`\mathbf{n\times n}` matrix as a *list of list of integers* and
returns a *Boolean* value stating whether the matrix is diagonal or not.

Note that in a diagonal matrix, diagonal entries can be zero as well,
but in our case diagonal entries are non-zero integers.

*Hint:* There is a list method that returns the number of occurrences of
a given element in that list.
