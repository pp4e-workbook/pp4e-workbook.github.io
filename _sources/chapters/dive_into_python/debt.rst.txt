Debt |0|
~~~~~~~~

Suppose you have borrowed $3000 with 2% monthly interest. For every
month you do not pay, your total debt becomes 1.02 times the original
debt.

Assuming that your plan is to return the money within 6 months and you
want to return it in equal amounts, write a program that outputs the
amount of money you have to pay every month until you clear your debt
(printing 2 digits after decimal point is sufficient).
