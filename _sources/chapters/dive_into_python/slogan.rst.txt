Slogan |4|
~~~~~~~~~~

You live in a city called Pawnee, and you share this beautiful city with
citizens that are really bad at spelling words. This town’s slogan is
"When you’re here, then you’re home." but your fellow citizens keep
spelling "then" as "than".

Given a misspelled slogan, fix the typo and print the correctly spelled
slogan.

*Since this is a question to practice, please try to manipulate the
string itself, rather than directly printing the correct city slogan.*
