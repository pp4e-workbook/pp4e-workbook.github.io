Exercise: Distance between Circles |3|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the two-dimensional plane, it is expected to find the shortest
distance between two circles that are defined by their radiuses and
coordinates of their centers. As it can be seen in the figure below, you
are expected to determine the length of the **bold** line and print it.

If the two circle intersect each other, the length would be 0 or less,
however, you can ignore that case, since no such input will be given.

**Hint:** *``sqrt()`` function is available to import from the ``math``
library. You can use it to find the square root of a number.*

Input format is: - x coordinate of the first circle - y coordinate of
the first circle - radius of the first circle - x coordinate of the
second circle - y coordinate of the second circle - radius of the second
circle

Output format is:

-  Length of the shortest distance (printing 2 digits after the decimal
   point is sufficient)
