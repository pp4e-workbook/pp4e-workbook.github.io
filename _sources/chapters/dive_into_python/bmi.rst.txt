Exercise: BMI |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *BMI* is defined as the body weight in kilogram divided by square of
height in meters.

Write a program that calculates BMI (Body Mass Index):

-  First, read two *integers* from the input, the height in centimeters
   and the weight in kilogram, respectively.
-  Then calculate the BMI and round the value to an integer.

-  Finally, print the result value.

**Hint:** *You can use the built-in ``round`` function to round the
float value to an integer.*
