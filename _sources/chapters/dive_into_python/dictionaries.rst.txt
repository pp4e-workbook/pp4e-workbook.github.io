Dictionaries |5|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dictionaries in Python are useful types to create lookup tables and
small databases. In this question you will design such a mini-database
to hold the grades of 3 students.

In this database you will hold 2 grades (midterm and final grades) of a
student as a tuple. These tuples must be indexed with the id of the
student.

After the information needed to create this database is given, you will
be given an id for one of the students to calculate the average of
his/her grades.

So, input format will be given in each line in the following order:

-  ID of the 1st Student
-  Midterm Grade of the 1st Student
-  Final Grade of the 1st Student
-  ID of the 2nd Student
-  Midterm Grade of the 2nd Student
-  Final Grade of the 2nd Student
-  ID of the 3rd Student
-  Midterm Grade of the 3rd Student
-  Final Grade of the 3rd Student
-  ID of the student whose grades will be calculated

IDs will be given as *integer*\ s and grades will be given as *floats*.
You should output the calculated average grade of the given student as a
*float*. 1 digit after the decimal point is sufficient for this output.

**Hint:** *While creating the database, you can use the same variables
instead of defining new ones.*
