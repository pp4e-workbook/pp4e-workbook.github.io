Exercise: Minimum and Maximum of Three |5|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that starts by reading three *integers* from the user.
Then, use the built-in ``min`` and ``max`` functions to find the
smallest and the largest values, respectively.

The middle value can be *calculated* once the minimum and the maximum
numbers are found. *(Think how you can do it without using
conditionals.)*

Finally, print the three values in *ascending* order in the same line.
