Movie Festival |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enzo Gorlomi is a famous movie critic. A movie festival will take place
in Paris and Gorlomi wants to watch every single movie. He gets so
excited that he loses track of time. Gorlomi starts watching the movies
at 11 oâ€™clock and goes on for *n* hours nonstop. You input *n*.

Can you remind Gorlomi what time it is after he finishes watching all
the movies? (The 24-hour clock is used to denote the time)
