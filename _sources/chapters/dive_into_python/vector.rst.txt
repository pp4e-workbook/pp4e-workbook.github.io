Vector |3|
~~~~~~~~~~

You need to complete two steps in this task. There are 3 points given to
you in the order of *x1*, *y1*, *x2*, *y2*, *x3*, *y3*.

Firstly you need to convert given coordinates into vectors, represented
as as *tuples* (e.g.Â *p1* as *(x1,y1)*).

Secondly, you will add the first two vectors, print the result, then
subtract the third one and print the result. Do not use the variables
you used earlier to get the input. The purpose here is to get familiar
with the indexing of a tuple.
