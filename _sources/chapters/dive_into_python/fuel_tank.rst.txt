Exercise: Fuel Tank |4|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that calculates how many times a truck needs to refill
its tank to complete a trip of a given length and the remaining liters
of fuel in the truck’s tank at the end of the trip.

The capacity of the truck’s fuel tank and its fuel consumption per 100
kilometers will be given as input followed by the length of the trip.
For the output you need to print the number of times to refill and the
remaining liters of fuel respectively. Note that you should print two
decimal places for the remaining liters of fuel.

You can assume that initially the tank is full. Also, the truck refills
its tank when it is completely empty. The only exception is it will not
refill the empty tank if the trip is completed (*see the 3rd example in
the sample i/o*).

**Hint:** You can use the :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{ceil()}}`
function from the :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{math}}` library.
