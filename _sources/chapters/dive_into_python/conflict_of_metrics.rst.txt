Exercise: Conflict of Metrics |1|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to go from a building in the city of Pawnee to a building in
the city of Eagleton. Your boss Ron gives you the distance between two
buildings in miles because he identifies himself as a *Proud American*.
But your friend Donna, who is going to drive you there, uses a European
car and she tells you the average speed you can travel in km/h
(kilometers per hour).

Given the distance in miles on the first line and speed in km/h on the
second line, calculate the time it will take you to travel to Eagleton
in minutes. Print this time as a *float* with 2 digits after decimal
point.

**Hint:** *One mile is approximately 1.6 kilometer.*
