Division |1|
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that takes two integers as input and divides the first
number (the dividend) with the second number (the divisor). The program
should print both the results of the division and the remainder.

You can assume that the first number is always bigger than the second
number, and both numbers are positive integers.
