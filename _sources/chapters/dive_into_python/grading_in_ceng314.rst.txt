Exercise: Grading in CENG314 |4|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Programming assignments in the *hypothetical* CENG314 course forms 5% of
the total grade. There are 5 programming assignments, each graded over
10. Only the highest 4 grades taken from these assignments are taken
into consideration, i.e. the assignment with the lowest grade is
ignored.

You need to write a program that asks the grades obtained from each
assignment and prints the total grade contribution from the programming
assignments in this course.

*Consider a student with grades 8, 9, 4, 3, 3. We ignore one of the 3’s.
The student has obtained a sum of 24 over 40, which computes as 3 over
5. The output will be 3.*

**Hint:** You might want to use the function
:math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{min()}}`. It takes a list, or at least two
arguments and returns the least element.
