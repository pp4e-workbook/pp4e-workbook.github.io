Cube Extraction |3|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

Suppose that a cube with an edge length of *n* is extracted from a
larger cube with an edge length of *m* as shown in the figure above.
Notice that the vertices of these two cubes do not overlap and they have
only one intersecting edge.

Then the new shape after extraction of the smaller cube looks like
following:

|image2|

Write a program that outputs the total surface area of this new shape as
an *integer*.

Inputs of your program will be given as *integers* in the following
order:

-  m: as the edge length of the larger cube
-  n: as the edge length of the extracted cube
