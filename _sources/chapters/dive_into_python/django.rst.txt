Exercise: Django |3|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

Dr.Â King Schultz and Django, as ruthless warriors of justice, are
wandering around America and hunting down wanted criminals. There are
*n* criminals they need to seize in total. For the first criminal they
take down, they receive *100* U.S. Dollars. Afterwards, for each
lawbreaker they apprehend, they are paid $100 more than the previous
one. Namely; if they take down 3 criminals one by one, they are going to
earn $100, $200 and $300 for the first, second and third one
respectively. However, bullets are not cheap these days. One bullet
costs :math:`m` Dollars. They are brooding on how much they are going to
profit, after wasting all those expensive bullets on filthy criminals.

Given *n* (in the first line) and *m* (in the second line) as input, can
you find how much money they are going to earn? Obviously, since Django
is an experienced sharpshooter, they will not use more than one bullet
for one criminal.
