Exercise: Database Migration |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are working for a fan club website, and for pricing reasons,
management told you that they have decided to change the database
service. Since you are in charge of the database, you are also in charge
of the database migration. You need to read from your old database files
and create new files that are compatible with the new database service.

The old database files are in the following format:

.. |2| image:: ../../figures/difficulty_three.png
   :class: difficulty

::

   Actor,EpisodeCount,LastOccurence
   Kenan Thompson,353,2020
   Seth Meyers,255,2018
   Fred Armisen,238,2020
   Kate McKinnon,179,2020

New database files should be in the following format:

::

   Actor:Kenan Thompson,EpisodeCount:353,LastOccurence:2020
   Actor:Seth Meyers,EpisodeCount:255,LastOccurence:2018
   Actor:Fred Armisen,EpisodeCount:238,LastOccurence:2020
   Actor:Kate McKinnon,EpisodeCount:179,LastOccurence:2020

Write a function named *format_for_migration* which takes input two
*string* values as file paths for input and output files, where the
format of the input and the output files are shown above. This function
must fill the output file with the records. The function should also
return an *integer* which is the number of records that are formatted.

*Hint:* You can use the built-in *map*\ (), *join*\ (), *rstrip*\ () and
*split*\ () functions.

.. container:: sampleio

   Sample I/O:

.. code:: default

   Sample function call:  
       format_for_migration("input.txt", "output.txt")  

   Content of the file "input.txt":  
       Actor,EpisodeCount,LastOccurence

       Steve Carell,18,2018
       Tom Hanks,18,2020
       John Mulaney,14,2020

   Return value:
       27

   Content of the file "output.txt" after function call:
