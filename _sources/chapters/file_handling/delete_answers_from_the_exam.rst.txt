Delete Answers from the Exam |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hasan is a teaching assistant at his university. He wrote exam questions
for students, but right before he uploaded them into the website he
realized that he forgot the answers of the questions in the text file.
Can you help Hasan with writing a function that deletes answers from the
question texts. Every 6th line in the text is the answer line.

Write a function named *delete_answers* which gets a *string* as a file
name where the question and answers are recorded as strings. This
function must write the questions without answers to a new file called
*new_questions.txt*.
