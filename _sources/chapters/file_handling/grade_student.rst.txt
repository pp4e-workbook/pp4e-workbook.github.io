Exercise: Grade Student |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are a teacher who is reading exam papers. Since it can be tiring to
read and grade hundreds of papers, you decide to write a function that
does the job for you.

Write a function named *grade_student* which gets two *strings* as the
file names. The first file contains the answer key, where each line
holds a record of question’s number, answer and grade separated by a
blank character. The second file contains a student’s answers, where
each line holds a record of question’s number and student’s answer. This
function should return an *integer* which is the total grade student
gets.

Note that your students answer all the questions. That means both files
always have the same number of lines.
