Exercise: Dice Game |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose three players are playing a simple dice game. The player with
the highest number in each round gets one point. In case of a draw, the
players share the one point. For example, if the dice throws for the
three players are 1, 5, 5; player 2 and player 3 will get 0.5 points if
the throws are 4, 4, 4; each of them will get 0.33 points.

Write a function named *dice_game* which gets a *string* as a file path
where the players’ names are recorded as *strings* in the first line
separated with a blank character, and their dice numbers are recorded in
bottom lines as *integers* separated with a blank character. The
function must return the winner player’s name and the points the player
got as *string*. In case of a draw, the function must return all winner
player’s names.

*Hint:* You may need to use *split*\ (), *readline*\ () and *rstrip*\ ()
functions.
