Exercise: Pass or Fail |2|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write a function named *pass_or_fail*, which takes two *strings* as the
paths of input and output files. Each line in the input file consists of
the names of students as *string*, their grades for first and second
midterm and final exam as *integers*, all separated with comma character
``','``.

The weights of the first and second midterm exams are **30%** each, and
the weight of the final exam is **40%** and a student *pass* if overall
grade is **60 and above** *fails* otherwise.

The function must write two *strings* separated with a comma character
``','`` in each line into the output file for each of student as their
name and status with either ``"Pass"`` or ``"Fail"``.
