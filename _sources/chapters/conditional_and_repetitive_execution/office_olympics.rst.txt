Exercise: Office Olympics |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Itâ€™s Office Olympics time! Jim is trying to find the medalists by
finding the three people that have the highest scores. Can you help him
find the three people who have the most wins?

Write a program that takes a list of 2-tuples which consists of a string
and an integer representing the name of people and their score and
prints a list of 3 strings which are the names of 3 winners. You can
assume that there are always at least three contestants in the Olympics.
