Orders from Abroad |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turkey has recently changed their tax policy against orders coming from
abroad. The new tax policy is as follows.

-  If price is within the interval (0,100], no tax.

-  If price is within the interval (100,1000], tax rate is 10%.

-  If the price of the product is greater than 1000, the applied tax
   rate is 20%.

Write a program that calculates the total tax amount when :math:`N` many
items are purchased.

The first line of input is :math:`N` as an integer, the count of items.
Each of the following :math:`N` lines contain the price of an item
purchased as an integer.

The output should be the total tax amount as a float.
