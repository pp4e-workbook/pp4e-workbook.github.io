Run-length Encoding |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The
basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single
count and the character. For example, the ``string`` “AAAABBBCCDAA”
would be encoded as “4A3B2C1D2A”.

Write a program to run-length encode a given string and print the
result. The input string will have no digits and has only uppercase
alphabetic characters.
