Exercise: Fizz Buzz |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are playing the game known as "Fizz Buzz". In this game you and your
friends count upwards from 1, but everytime the number is a multiple of
3 you say "Fizz" instead. For multiples of 5 you say "Buzz" instead. For
multiples of both, you say "Fizz Buzz".

Write a program that takes an integer **n** as input, prints the numbers
form 1 to **n**, replacing the numbers with "Fizz", "Buzz" and "Fizz
Buzz" according to the game.

*Hint:* The sample i/o given below is printed by calling the
:math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{print()}}` function with the additional
argument ``end`` as ``'\t'`` (e.g.Â ``print("Fizz", end='\t')``) for the
sake of readability.
