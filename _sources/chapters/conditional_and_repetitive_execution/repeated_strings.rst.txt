Repeated Strings |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this question it is asked to determine whether the first half of a
string is exactly the same of its second half. If the string is not
halvable (i.e. has odd number of elements) then and error message has to
be printed.

| For example, "abab" is such a string. When it is divided into two
  equal parts, the parts are "ab" and "ab" and these are the same. On
  the other hand, "abba" is not such a string, because the two halves
  are "ab" and "ba" and they are not the same. If the input string is
  such a ‘repeated string’, you should print "Yes", otherwise, you
  should print "No". If the length of the string is odd then print
  "Error".
