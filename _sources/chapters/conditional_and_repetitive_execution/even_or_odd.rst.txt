Even or Odd |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to decide about the parity of a number (whether it is odd or
even) it is enough to inspect its last digit. Write a program that reads
a three-digit number from the user. Then checks if the number and
reversed form of that number is even or odd (If the number is 123, then
the reversed form is 321.) If both are even, print "Even" or if both are
odd print "Odd". If they are different from each other, then print their
parity repectively (i.e.Â if the number is even print "Even Odd" else
print "Odd Even").

*Hint: To find whether the reversed version is even or odd, inspecting
only the first digit of the actual number is enough.*
