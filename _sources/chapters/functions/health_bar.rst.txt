Health Bar |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are a warrior who is given a difficult quest to complete. In this
journey, you encounter various types of troubles including monsters. You
have to fight them off to continue and you want to see how much the next
attack will hurt you.

Write a function called *health_bar* to show your current health status.
This function takes 3 integers: (1) your base health, (2) your current
health and (3) the damage you take. The function returns your current
health status as a string with “X”s (remaining health) and "_"s (missing
health). Here are some accompanying specifications:

-  Your base health and the damage you take will always be a positive
   integer.
-  The damage you take can be more than your current health.
-  The length of your health bar string must match your base health.

Consider the following case: If your base health is 9 and your current
health is 7 when you take 3 damage, your current health bar becomes
“XXXX____\_”.

*Hint:* You can use string repetition.
