City Sushi |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cartman wants to eat some sushi. So, he goes to City Sushi. The menu has
:math:`N` sushis in it, with indexes starting from 1, and he has the
prices of them as a list of integers. He would like to choose sushis
between a starting and an ending index.

Write a function named *total_price* that takes a list of integers as
the prices of sushis, and two integers as the starting and ending index
of the selection (with the ending index excluded). The function must
return the total cost of selected sushis as an integer.
