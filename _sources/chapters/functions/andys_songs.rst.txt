Andy’s Songs |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Andy is a guitar player, and nowadays he and his band (Mouse Rat) are
not on the best terms. His band members want to force him to practice
more, but they also know that Andy cannot play songs with complexity
values larger than a number depending on his mood. Every day the band
members give Andy a list of new songs to practice.

Write a function named as *andys_songs* that takes the list of song
complexity values as a *list of integers* and Andy’s mood as parameters
as an *integer*, and return an *integer* indicating how many songs that
Andy can play on that day.
