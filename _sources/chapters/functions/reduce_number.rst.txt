Exercise: Reduce Number |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a function named *reduce_number* that takes an integer and reduces
the number by taking the sum of the digits. If the summation has more
than one digit, the reduction is applied again. This continues until the
result is a single digit number. The function must return the reduced
number as a one-digit integer.

For example, if we call the *reduce_number* function with 325565 as
argument, then the number is reduced to 26 first. Since 26 is a
two-digit number, then we reduce it again and we get 8 as the final
result.

*Hint:* You can define a helper function to calculate the sum of a
numberâ€™s digits.
