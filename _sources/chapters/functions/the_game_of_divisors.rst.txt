The Game of Divisors |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nazif and Osman were really bored during the lockout and they have come
up with an exciting game. The rules are simple: they both choose an
integer and whoever has an integer with more divisors wins.

Write a function named *winner* that takes two integers where the first
one is the choice of Nazif and the second is Osman’s number. The
function must return a string of either “Nazif” or “Osman” depending on
that who is the winner of the game. If there is a tie, then the function
must return “Draw”.

*Hint:* You can define a helper function to calculate the number of
divisors of a given number.
