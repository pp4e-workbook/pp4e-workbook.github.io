Exercise: Palindrome |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A palindrome is a piece of text which can be read as the same backwards
and forward. For example, “onino” is a palindrom whereas “onion” is not.
Your task is to write a function called *is_palindrome* that takes a
string and returns ``True`` if the given string is palindrome and
``False`` otherwise.

*Hint:* Use recursion.
