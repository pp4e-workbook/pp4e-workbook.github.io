Anagram |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~

Two words are anagrams if they consist of the same letters, but in a
different order. For example, “palm” and “lamp” are anagrams because
each contains one ‘p’, one ‘a’, one ‘l’, and one ‘m’. Write a function
named as *anagram* that takes two strings as arguments, and returns
``True`` if the strings are anagrams or returns ``False`` otherwise.

*Hint:* You can use dictionaries to keep track of different characters
in the input string and count them.
