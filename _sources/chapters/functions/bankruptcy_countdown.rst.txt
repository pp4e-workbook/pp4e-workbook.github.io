Exercise: Bankruptcy Countdown |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*“When a person, company or organization is unable to pay their debts or
make payment to their employees, it is called bankruptcy.”*

Your friend Tom co-owns an entertainment company called "Entertainment
720", but none of the owners know anything about finance or accounting.
Tom asks for your help to manage their finances and you accept to help.
When looking into the numbers, you realize that the company is about to
go bankrupt.

Write a function named *countdown* that takes two arguments: (1) an
integer for the amount of money Entertainment 720 has left and (2) a
list of integers for the monthly payments done to the employees. This
function should return how many months Entertainment 720 has before
going fully bankrupt as an integer. If their money is insufficient from
the beginning then the function must return 0.
