Exercise: Finding Median |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculus exam results are announced and your result is above the
announced average. You want to have an idea about the letter grade you
will get, and to do this you ask everyone you know about their exam
results. You want to calculate the median of the results, which will
give you some more idea about the distribution of the grades so that you
can take a better guess about your letter grade.

Write a function named *find_median* that takes a list of integers as
the distribution of the grades and returns an integer as the median of
this distribution. If the list has an even length, the function must
return the higher of the two middle elements.

*Hint*: You can use the built-in function
:math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{sorted()}}` to get the grades in the
increasing order.
