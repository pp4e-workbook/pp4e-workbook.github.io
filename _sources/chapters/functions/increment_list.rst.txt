Exercise: Increment List |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a function named *increment_list* that takes a list of integers
and returns a new list with all elements of the argument list
incremented by one. You need to make sure that the original list does
**not** change. To achieve this, you will need to make a copy of the
original list.

*Hint:* You can use slicing to get a (shallow) copy of the list.

.. container:: sampleio

   Sample I/O:

.. |2| image:: ../../figures/difficulty_two.png
   :class: difficulty

.. code:: default

   # Use variable assignment to be able to observe the original list
   # after the function call

   >>> a = [1, 2, 3, 10, 15]
   >>> a
   [1, 2, 3, 10, 15]
   >>> increment_list(a)
   [2, 3, 4, 11, 16]
   >>> a
   [1, 2, 3, 10, 15]
