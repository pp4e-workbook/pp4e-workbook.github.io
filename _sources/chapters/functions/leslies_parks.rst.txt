Exercise: Leslie’s Parks |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leslie Knope is the deputy director of the department of Parks and
Recreation. She wants to build a park in front of all of her friends’
houses. She loves her friends so much, but she also loves being a
servant to the citizens and values their opinions. Being the reasonable
thing to do, she holds a public forum to take a vote for each park to be
built or not. For each park, if the votes in favor are **double or more
than** the votes against, that park is decided to be built. Can you help
Tom, Leslie’s lazy co-worker who is in charge of doing the calculation,
so that he can decide if a park is going to be built or not?

Write a function named *to_be_built* that takes two integers as the
votes in favor and against the park and returns a string either
``"YES"`` if the park is going to be built, or ``"NO"`` if not.
