Send Bulk SMS |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A small business wants to send bulk messages to a group of customers to
boost their sales and to annoy the people (mostly to annoy the people).
The phone book of the customers they have is implemented as a dictionary
in the following buggy function which takes the name of person as a
*string* and return their phone number in the same type:

   :class: difficulty

.. code:: python

   def get_phone_number(person):
       phone_dict = {"Jerry Seinfeld":"+1 960-454-6956",
                     "George Constanza":"+1 844-833-4965",
                     "Elaine Benes":"+1 543-920-5729",
                     "Cosmo Kramer":"+1 556-673-6702",
                     "Jim Halpert":"+1 867-767-7664",
                     "Pam Beesly":"+1 410-570-7381",
                     "Michael Scott":"+1 657-220-6601",
                     "Dwight Schrute":"+1 940-573-6702",
                     "Rachel Green":"+1 813-856-3347",
                     "Monica Geller":"+1 527-324-1403",
                     "Ross Geller":"+1 687-801-6781",
                     "Phoebe Buffay":"+1 208-702-5161",
                     "Joey Tribbiani":"+1 908-665-3975",
                     "Chandler Bing":"+1 444-970-5300"}

       return phone_dict[person]

Why we called this function buggy? Because it never checks whether the
given person is in the phone book or not. In Python, if a dictionary
does not have the given key, :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{KeyError}}`
exception is raised.

Although the function above is not safe for direct use, we have the
reliable function that takes a phone number as a string, sends SMS to
that phone number (hypothetically) and returns ``True``, indicating that
the process is successfully performed, as given below:

.. code:: python

   def send_sms(number):
       # sends message #
       print("Message is successfully sent to " + number)
       return True

Write a function named *``send_bulk_sms``* which takes a list of
customers’ names as *a list of strings* and sends message to each of
them whose number is registered in the phone book by using the functions
above. Obviously, any exception thrown by *``get_phone_number``*
function must be handled in your implementation and reported in the
following format:

*“Customer is not found in the phone book: {Customer Name}”*

*Note:* We normally do not want a function to print anything beside
doing its task and return the value as it is excepted. However, in this
case, the function is required to do logging. Therefore, it is proper to
use :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{print()}}` function and not to return
any value.
