Railway Statistics |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this question, you will analyze some railway statistics regarding the
length of all railroads and the number of passengers year by year in
Turkey.

You can fetch this data from the following link:

http://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~ceng240/data/railway.csv

Here are the instructions of the task:

-  Read this data by using :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{pandas}}`
   module.
-  Get the lengths of railroads, in a
   :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{numpy}}` array with *dtype* as *int*
   from the field named *Length*.
-  Get the number of passengers, in a
   :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{numpy}}` array with *dtype* as *int*
   from the field named *Passenger*.
-  Plot the figure for the lengths of railroads vs. the number of
   passengers by using
   :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{matplotlib.pyplot}}` and save in your
   computer (see :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{savefig()}}` function in
   the related module.).
-  Apply min max normalization to both fields. During this normalization
   each value in the fields is calculated according to the formula
   below:

   .. math::  new\_value =  \frac{value - min\_value}{max\_value - min\_value} 

-  Plot the figure for the lengths of railroads vs. the number of
   passengers by using
   :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{matplotlib.pyplot}}` with their
   normalized values again and save in your computer.

Write a python program to complete tasks above. You are recommended to
define a function in case of a repeating task.
