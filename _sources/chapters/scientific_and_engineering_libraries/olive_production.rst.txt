Olive Production |2|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this question, you will analyze data extracted for the amounts of
produced olives year by year in Turkey.

You can fetch this data from the following link:

http://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~ceng240/data/olives.csv

Here are the instructions for analyzing this data:

-  Read this data by using :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{pandas}}`
   module.
-  Get the years, in a :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{numpy}}` array with
   *dtype* as *int* from the field named *Year*
-  Get the amount of produced olives, in a
   :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{numpy}}` array with *dtype* as *int*
   from the field named *Olive*
-  Create a filter array depending on the values being over or under the
   average of the productions in years.

   -  *This filter array is automatically created when you make a
      comparison between the array itself and the average value. It
      includes Boolean values as much as the length of the original
      array, True for the values that are greater than the average and
      False for otherwise.*

-  Get the production amounts that are over the average and their years
   by using the filter array you created. (*Hint:* Use indexing [ ])
-  Plot the figure for the years vs.Â the amount of produced olives by
   using :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{matplotlib.pyplot}}` for the
   filtered data and save it in your computer (see
   :math:`\color{purple}{\texttt{savefig()}}` function in the related
   module.).
